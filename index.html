<h1>world cup</h1>
  <p>
  the FIFA world cup. Upsets, heartbreak, pain and sadness and hope, joy, glory and wonder in 60 matches.<br> This year the world cup was hosted in Qatar, the first time the tournament has ever been hosted by a middle eastern country.<br> However numerous controversies caused this opening match to break two whole records; the least ever watched opening game (only 3.8 million people watched on TV and the stadium did not sell out)<br> And the first ever host nation to lose in a world cup opening match.<br> I am now gonna hand out awards and rank teams and players in different catergories.
